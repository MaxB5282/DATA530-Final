# DATA530-Final

## Set-up

In order to replicate this code, make sure to have all necessary library installed from the import section from the main notebook labeled 'Final Project'.

Make sure to download all of the files listed.

One note is that this repositotry does not include the tweets as github would not allow file sizes that large to be uploaded. In order to download those files containing tweets, visit the corresponding kaggle 
page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/esterinkojtari/bakhmut-sentiment-analysis).


## Notes

The Final_Project.pdf file contains a report style output of the code from the notebook. Unfortunatley, I could not figure out how to get the interactive plot to render
through quarto, or with inserted png files of the plot. So when reading the report, refer to the pdf labeled, "newplot(1).jpeg.pdf" in the "Civilian" section of the report.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of various aspects related to the conflict in Ukraine offers valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of the situation. The examination of losses incurred by the Russian army in terms of equipment reveals notable trends. The data indicates consistent increases in losses across the top five most used pieces of equipment since February 2022. Specifically, Amphibious Personnel Carriers (APCs), characterized by their armored vehicles with turrets, emerge as the most frequently used equipment.

A detailed analysis of equipment trends further distinguishes between logarithmic growth observed in APCs and tanks, suggesting a potential plateau, and exponential growth in vehicles, fuel tanks, field artillery, and drones, implying an accelerating rate of losses. The interpretation of these trends leads to two key insights. Firstly, the increased losses may be attributed to a larger deployment of equipment by Russia since the beginning of the conflict. Secondly, the Ukrainian Army appears to be progressively improving its ability to neutralize Russian equipment, suggesting a strategic advantage for Ukraine.

Moving beyond equipment losses, the examination of personnel losses by the Russian army reveals a distressing linear trend since February 2022. The magnitude of human casualties evokes a profound emotional response, highlighting the human toll and tragedy associated with armed conflicts. The sentiment analysis of tweets containing the word "Kyiv" provides a unique perspective on public sentiment across different languages. Notable spikes and dips in sentiment coincide with significant events, such as attacks on Kyiv, the anniversary of the war, and global responses to Russian actions.

The interactive map plotting incidents resulting in civilian injury or casualties, colored by responsible weapons, serves as a crucial tool for understanding the geographical distribution of the conflict's impact. Insights gained from the map, such as the prevalence of cluster munitions in Eastern Ukraine and the widespread use of cruise missiles, can inform strategic decisions to better defend civilians. The analysis underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making to allocate appropriate resources and equipment for the protection of civilians in conflict zones.

In summary, the multi-faceted analysis of equipment losses, personnel casualties, sentiment trends, and incident mapping offers a nuanced understanding of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. These insights contribute to a broader comprehension of the strategic, human, and societal dimensions of the conflict, highlighting the challenges and opportunities for all stakeholders involved.
