# DATA530-Final

## Set-up

In order to replicate this code, make sure to have all necessary library installed from the import section from the main notebook labeled 'Final Project'.

Make sure to download all of the files listed.

One note is that this repositotry does not include the tweets as github would not allow file sizes that large to be uploaded. In order to download those files containing tweets, visit the corresponding kaggle 
page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/esterinkojtari/bakhmut-sentiment-analysis).


## Notes

The Final_Project.pdf file contains a report style output of the code from the notebook. Unfortunatley, I could not figure out how to get the interactive plot to render
through quarto, or with inserted png files of the plot. So when reading the report, refer to the pdf labeled, "newplot(1).jpeg.pdf" in the "Civilian" section of the report.
